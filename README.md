# Blockchain Protocol Engineering Roadmap

This repository documents my learning journey toward becoming a **Blockchain Protocol Engineer** which I started around June 2025 — building, optimizing, and securing blockchain infrastructure and protocols.

---

## Objectives
- Understand blockchain architecture from first principles  
- Learn how consensus mechanisms work (PoW, PoS, BFT, etc.)  
- Get hands-on with networking, cryptography, and data structures  
- Study existing protocols (Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot, Bitcoin)  
- Build experimental mini-protocols for learning  
- Contribute to open-source blockchain projects  

---

## 🗂 Structure
- `roadmap/` → topic-based learning guides and notes  
- `experiments/` → hands-on projects and protocol prototypes  
- `resources/` → curated list of readings, repos, and tools  
- `reflections/` → weekly learning summaries

## 💡 Vision for me
Build a strong foundation in blockchain protocol design and become a core contributor to a major open-source blockchain.
